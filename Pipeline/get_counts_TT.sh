# This SLURM submission script counts sample configurations without conditioning on an outgroup. It implements 'count_sample_confs_per_ind_TT.py' for all
# 22 autosomes, and for as many pairwise individual comparisons as you choose.
# 'Ind' is a keyword representing the full vcf filenames and paths, which is assigned by the USER in 'get_file_name.py'.
# In the example below, jobs will be submitted to count sample configurations for 3 pairwise comparisons: Ind1 vs Ind2, Ind1 vs Ind3, Ind2 vs Ind3.
# POINTLESS AND TO BE REMOVED
